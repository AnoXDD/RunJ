# RunJ
A handy tool to maximize my efficiency by replacing Win+R

## Background
I really do not like it when Microsoft takes down Charm, a tiny box that displays current time and date, in Windows 10, which forced me to unhide my taskbar just in order to know the time and date (I hide my taskbar 99% of all the time because I don't really use it).

Then later I read that Chrome is going to take down their App Launcher, another handy app for me launch website or Chrome app quickly from desktop. Now two of my favorites are about to be gone. It's time for me to do something. 

So that was what made me to write this tiny application that combines the functionality of Charm (time and date), Chrome App Launcher and Win+R (Run). To make it more customizable, the user can modify an external configuration file to instruct it what to do given some inputs. 

## Usage
After compiling (or simply download it [here](https://github.com/AnoXDD/RunJ/raw/master/MyCalculatorv1/bin/Release/RunJ.exe)) the .exe file. Run it and put `$$` and then press `Enter` to generate a new config file and open it (after this first setup, do the same thing to edit this config file).

More details on the config file is listed in the generated file. For more commands, put `$h`.

##Misc. 

The name is called MyCalculatorv1 simply because I modified the code based on another project
